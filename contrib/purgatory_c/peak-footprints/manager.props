## The following parameters are not (yet) taken into

# Clustal executable name. If executable path is not in the PATH,
# a full path to the clustalW executable file must be provided.
clustalw_command=/home/spinelli/Tools/clustalw2/clustalw2

# Name of the MAFFT script or executable file. If the MAFFT bin directory is not in the PATH,
# a full path must be provided. Default value for this option is 'mafft --auto'
