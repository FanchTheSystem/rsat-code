"""Version : v0.2

Description :
    This program was developed in order to get informations on all studied species'genes available on the Genoscope server.
    It runs only in Python 2.7 and with the workflows_functions.py file.

Authors :
    - Alexandra BOMANE    alexandra.bomane@laposte.net
    - Melanie COLOMBIER    mel.colombier@free.fr
    - Aur√©lie BERGON       aurelie.bergon@inserm.fr
Usage :
     microscope_get_microscope_get_MetaCycReactions.py -org organism_name  [-o outfile_name] [--output_file outfile_name]

Options :
    -h | -help
        Display full help message.
    -org organism_name
        Selected organism. Mandatory argument.
        To get available organisms, refer to supported_organisms_genoscope.py
    -o | --output_file  outfile_name
        If no output file is specified, the result is printed on the standard output.
        Else, 2 files are returned : a tabulated file presenting the server response and an error report.

Execution :
    The program launch a first request to the Genoscope server.

    This request is the same as in supported_organisms_genoscope.py (http://mgalileo.genoscope.cns.fr/api/microscope/organisms/list).
    It returns all public organisms of MicroScope database in json format.

    The Json object is parsed in order to get the Genoscope Id of the chosen organism.

    This Id allows the program to send a second request to the server.
    This request was established thanks the Genoscope API "/genomes/genomic-objects/list/Organism'sGenoscopeId" that returns a Json object too.
    The second request response is parsed to make the result more readable.

    Eventually, according to the use of -o | --output_file option, we have 2 possibilities :
        - The result is displayed on the standard output and the error detail is displayed in the standard error.
        - The result is written in a tabulated file and a precise error report file is returned too.
