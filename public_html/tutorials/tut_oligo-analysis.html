      <a name=intro></a><h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>Knowing that a set of genes are co-expressed (e.g. they show
	similar expression profiles in an microarray experiment), we
	can suppose that some elements are shared by their upstream
	region, and one would like to detect such elements. </p>
      
    <p>We
      implemented a simple and fast method to extract such elements,
	based on a detection of over-represented
      oligonucleotides. This method has been described in detail in
      <A target=_blank  HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=PubMed&cmd=Retrieve&list_uids=9719638&dopt=Abstract">
	  J.Mol. Biol. (1998) 281, 827-842</A>.
    </p>
    
    <a name=example></a><h2>Example of utilization</h2>

    <p>We will illustrate this approach with a set of genes for which
      the regulatory sites is well known : the genes responding to a
      stress in methionine. The motif discovery program will of course
      not receive any indication about these known regulatory
      motifs. We will only use them <I>a posteriori</I> to compare the
      discovered motifs with those documented in the literature.</p>

    <a name='interpret'></a><h2>Interpreting the results</h2>
    
    
    <h3>Statistical parameters</h3>

    <p>
      Note the particularly high degree of over-representation for the
      hexanucleotide <TT>CACGTG</TT>. Thirteen occurrences are
      observed, whereas only 1.22 would be expected by chance.  CACGTG
      is the core of the binding site for Met4p, the main
      transcription factor for the regulation of methionine
      biosynthesis.</p>

    <p>
      The P-value (column occ_P) represents the probability to observe
      at least 13 occurrences when expecting 1.22. For CACGTG, it is
      of the order of 10<sup>-9</sup>. However, this P-value might be
      misleading, because in this analysis we considered 2080 possible
      patterns. Indeed, there are 4096 possible hexanucleotides, but
      we regrouped each of them with its reverse complement, resulting
      in 2080 distinct patterns. Thus, we performed a simultaneous
      test of 2080 hypotheses.</p>

    <p>
      The E-value (column occ_E) provides a more reliable and
      intuitive statistics than the P-value. The E-value is simply
      obtained by multiplying the P-value by the number of distinct
      patterns. It represents the number of patterns with the same
      level of over-representation which would be expected by chance
      alone. For CACGTG, the E-value is of the order of
      10<sup>-6</sup>, indicating that, if we would submit random
      sequences to the program, such a level of over-representation
      would be expected every 1,000,000 trials.</p>

    <p>
      An even more intuitive statistics is provided by the
      significance index (column occ_sig), which is the minus log
      transform (in base 10) of the E-value. The higher values are
      associated to the most significant patterns. On the average, a
      significance higher than 0 would be expected by chance alone
      once per trial (sequence set). A score higher than 1 every ten
      trials, a score higher than 2 every 100 trials, and a score
      higher than 6 every 10<sup>6</sup> trials.</p>

    <p>
      The default parameters were chosen to return no more than one
      pattern per sequence set (threshold on significance is 0). With
      these settings, the analysis of a small regulon typically
      returns half a dozen of hexanucleotides, among the 2080
      possibilities. In addition, these hexanucleotides are related
      with each other, and can be assembled to provide a more refined
      description of the predicted binding sites, as discussed below.</p>

    <h3>Clusters of mutually overlapping patterns reveal larger motifs,
      and/or motif degeneracy</h3>
    
    <p>Below the oligo-analysis result (the table with one row per
      oligo and one column per statistics), you can see the result of
      pattern-assembly. with the MET family, two clusters of patterns
      can be formed. </p>

    <p>
      The first cluster contains the most significant hexanucleotide,
      CACGTG, and the strongly overlapping ACGTGa. In addition, since
      in our analysis we considered both strands as equivalentm, the
      reverse complement of this hexanucleotide, tCACGT,is also
      considered. The assembly of these three hexanucleotides results
      in an octanucleotide, tCACGTGa, which perfectly corresponds to
      the Met4p consensus.</p>

    <h3>A single analysis can reveal binding sites for multiple
      transcription factors</h3>
    
    <p>
      The second cluster of hexanucleotides forms a completely
	  different motif, whose consensus is aactgtgg. This
	  corresponds to the binding site of the homolog transcription
	  factors Met31p and Met32p, which cooperate with Met4p for
	  the regulation of methionine biosynthesis and sulfur
	  assimilation.</p>

    <h3>Choice of the significance threshold</h3>

    <p>
      The pattern assembly left one isolated pattern, TAGTCA, which is
      related to neither Met4p nor to Met31p binding sites. The significance
      of this isolated pattern is very close to 0, and it is likely to be a
      false poitive.</p>

    <p>
      One possibility would be to increase the threshold of
      significance in order to reduce the rate of false
      positive. however, this would also result in the loss of some
      biologically relevant patterns, like ACTGTG and CTGTGG, which
      contributed to the description of the Met31p binding site. Thus,
      our strategy is to set the significance threshold to 0, and to
      ignore isolated patterns which have a low significance index.</p>

    <a name='map'></a><h2>Drawing a feature-map with the discovered patterns</h2>

    <div class='protocol'>
      <ol>
	<li><p> In the bottom of the result page, click on the
	    button <b>Pattern matching (dna-pattern)</b>.  The same form
	    is displayed as in the
	    previous <a href="tut_dna-pattern.html">tutorial on pattern
	      matching</A>, but this time the <b>Query pattern(s)</b> box
	    has been automatically filled with the result of
	    oligonucleotide analysis. Do not change anything to the form
	  and click <b>GO</b>.</p></li>
	
	<li><p> The list of matching positions of the
	    over-represented oligonucleotides is displayed.  Notice
	    that each match is associated to a score, which is the
	    significance obtained for that hexanucleotide in
	    oligo-analysis.</p></li>
	
	<li><p>On the bottom of the result page, click
	    the <b>Feature map</b> bbutton.</p></li>
	
	<li><p> A form appears which will allow yo to generate a graphical
	    representation of the matching positions.</p></li>

	<li><p>Fill the <b>From</b> box with -800,</p></li>
	
	<li><p>Fill the <b>To</b> box with 0</p></li>
	
	  <li><p>For the <b>Feature handle</b> option, select "none".</p></li>
	  
	<li><p>Make sure that the option <b>Feature thickness
	      proportional to score</b> is activated.</p></li>
	
	<li><p>Click <b>GO</b>.</p></li>
	
	<li><p> The feature map appears. The boxes have now different
	      thicknesses, reflecting the respective matching score. </p></li>
	
      </ol>
      </div>
    
    <p>
      This proportional thickness strongly emphazises the CACGTG
      pattern, which is the core of the main transcription factor for
      the selected genes. Notice the overlap between these very high
      boxes and smaller boxes. These clusters of mutually overlapping
      boxes indicate that the consensus extends over 6 base pairs of
      the core (most matches correspond to the octanucleotide
      tCACGTGa). You can check this by positioning the cursor above a
      feature box, and reading the matching sequence in the status bar
      of your web browser.</p>

    <p>
      A problem with the automatic feature thickness, is that some
      patterns with a lower significance are barely visible, including
      the Met31p binding sites. we can now refine the representation
      to increase the visibility of these low-scoring motifs.</p>
	
    <div class='protocol'>
      <ol>
	<li><p>Come <b>back</b> to the feature-map form. </p></li>

	<li><p>Set the <b>min feature thickness</b> to 5. This will forc the
	    boxes to have a thickness of at least 5 pixels.</p></li>

	<li><p>Leave all other parameters as descriibed above, and
	    click <b>GO</b>.</p></li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <p>
      This modification allows you to better detect the Met31p binding
      sites. Notice that these also appear as clusters of mutually
      overlapping boxes, which emphazises the conserved octanucleotide
      <tt>AAACTGTG</tt>.</p>
