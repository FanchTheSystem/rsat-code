</center>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The Regulatory Sequence Analysis Tools suite (RSAT) is committed to providing a welcoming and free experience harassment for all, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race , ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof) or technology options. We do not tolerate harassment of developers, users or participants of any of the courses or workshops organized by the RSAT Developers Team (RDT) in any way. Language and sexual images are not suitable for any communication, including emails, messages, lectures, workshops, social events, Twitter and other online media. RSAT users, developers, or participants in courses and workshops who violate these rules may be punished or banned from participating in any RSAT related event or activity.

<P>
This code of conduct applies to all participants, including staff and leadership of RSAT, and applies to all modes of interaction, both in person and online, including project repositories RSAT GitHub, forum discussions, Slack channels and Twitter.

<P>
<B>RSAT developers, users and participants in courses and workshops accept:</B>
<ul>
<li>Be considered in speech and actions, actively seek to recognize and respect the boundaries of others in attendance.</li>
<li>Refrain from behaviors and degrading expressions, discriminatory or harassing. Harassment includes, but is not limited to: deliberate intimidation; stalking; unwanted photo or recording; sustained or deliberate interruption of the talks and other events; inappropriate physical contact; use of sexual imagery or discriminatory comments or jokes; and unwanted sexual attention. If you feel someone has harassed or treated someone inappropriately, please report to any member of the RDT.</li>
<li>If in a course or workshop, take care of each other. Contact a member of the organizing committee of the workshop if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress or violations of this code of conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.</li>
<li>Use your full name and not an alias in any internal communication channel such that we can create a secure environment and enforce the code of conduct.</li>
</ul>

<P>
<B>Need help?</B>
<P>
If you have any questions or concerns, contact Morgane Thomas-Chollier, Jacques van Helden, Alejandra Medina-Rivera, in person or via rsat-contact[AT]list01.biologie.ens.fr.
<P>
If any of the users, developers, or participants in courses and workshops engages in bullying behavior, RDT can take any legal action we deem appropriate, including, among others, warn the accused or ask the offender to step out of the project, refrain from participating in online communication related to RSAT or leave a course/workshop. (If you feel you have been unjustly accused of violating this code of conduct, you must contact RDT with a brief description of your complaint).
<P>
We welcome comments on this and all other aspects of RSAT, and we thank developers and participants in courses/workshops for working with us to make it a safe, pleasant and friendly experience for all involved.
