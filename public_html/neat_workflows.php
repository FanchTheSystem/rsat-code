<h2><a href=\"NeAT_home.html\">Network Analysis Tools (NeAT)</A> - Taverna workflows
</h2>
NeAT Taverna workflows were developped with the help of Eric Vervisch.
</center>
<br>
<p/>
The <a href=\"http://taverna.sourceforge.net/\" target='_blank'> Taverna </a> workbench provides tools to build, edit and browse workflows. Its graphical interface facilitates an easy building and running of workflows over distributed computer resources.
<p/>
We present below some workflows. They use NeAT and other resources exposed as Web Services. They can be interconnected into reusable  analysis workflows.
<p/>
You can execute those workflows with your own data. Meanwhile data file examples are also available for each workflow.
<p/><b>HOW TO ?</b> To execute these workflows in the Taverna Workbench, download the
workflow (SCUFL XML format) on your machine and load it in Taverna with \"File > Open workflow...\".
Alternatively, copy and paste the URL of the workflow download link into
Taverna with \"File > Open workflow location...\". Sample input data are
provided for each workflow. To use a sample input, download  the
file on your machine, then load this file in Taverna with \"File > Run
workflow >Load input\".

<h3> How to find paths in protein-protein-interaction networks?</h3>

Yeast two-hybrid datasets are known to be very noisy. However, a
protein-protein-interaction confirmed by several different experiments might be more reliable
than one found in only one experiment.
This example demonstrates a workflow that carries out path finding on the intersection
network of two different yeast two-hybrid networks.

<td valign=\"top\">
In this workflow, the following steps are performed:
<p/>	     - first, the intersection between two undirected networks obtained from yeast two-hybrid data is
               computed with <a href=\"compare_graphs_form.php\">compare-graphs</a>
<p/>	     - second, <a href=\"pathfinder_form.php\">Pathfinder</a> is launched on the intersection network

<h3> How to identify biologically relevant clusters in biological networks?</h3>

This workflow forms a part of the Nature protocol presenting NeAT. In the first step,
we extract clusters from a yeast-specific network obtained
from <a href=\"http://string.embl.de/\" target=\"_blank\">STRING</a>.
Next, these clusters are compared to
<a href=\"http://mips.gsf.de/\" target=\"_blank\">MIPS</a> complexes,
which comprise known physical interactions between proteins.
We end up with a list that gives for each MIPS cluster the score of its overlap with
clusters obtained from the STRING network.

</a>
</td>
<td valign=\"top\">
In this workflow, the following steps are performed:
<p/>	     - first, clusters are extracted from the input network using <a href=\"mcl_form.php\">MCL</a>.
<p/>	     - second, the clusters are compared to known protein complexes obtained from MIPS
               with <a href=\"compare_classes_form.php\">compare_classes</a>

<h3> How to find paths in organism-specific metabolic networks?</h3>

Path finding in organism-specific metabolic networks allows to detect
pathway variants that are specific to an organism or to a set of related organisms.
<a href=\"http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html\" target=\"_blank\">KEGG PATHWAY</a>
is a database that offers organism-specific metabolic information.

In this workflow, the following steps are performed:
<p/>	     - first, an organism-specific metabolic network is constructed using the <a href=\"keggnetworkprovider_form.php\">KEGG network provider</a>
