descr:

    Computes frequency distribution of numerical values found in a column of a tab-delimited text file. Class intervals can be specified as a fixed value (-ci) or automatically derived from the data.

parameters:
    - name: i
      description: inputfile. Only the numbers will be read, other words are ignored.
      type: file
      required: false
    - name: max
      description: numbers strictly greater than max are not taken into account.
      type: int
    - name: min
      description: nusmbers strictly smaller than min are not taken into account. min also determines the lower limit of the first class.
      type: int
      required: false
    - name: ci
      description:  class interval. If not specified, takes the value (max - min)/20 so that 21 classes are specified.
      type: int
      required: false
    - name: col
      description: column to which apply the program. This option can be used iteratively.
      type: int
      required: false
    - name: from
      description: inferior limit for the classes to display values lower than this limit are however taken into account in the calculation of statistics (mean, variance, ...) and of class frequencies (In contrast with the -min option).
      type: int
      required: false
    - name: to
      description: superior limit for the classes to display values higher than this limit are however taken into account in the calculation of statistics (mean, variance, ...) and of class frequencies (In contrast with the -max option).
      type: int
      required: false
    - name: thr
      description: threshold. Only display classes with absolute frequency higher than or equal to the threshold. This option is useful for sparse data, where many classes do not contain any observation (-thr 1).
      type: int
      required: false
