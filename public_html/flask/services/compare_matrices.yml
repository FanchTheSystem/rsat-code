    description: Only analyze the first X motifs of the second file. This options is convenient for quick testing before starting the full analysis.
    type: int
  - name: skip1
    description: Skip the first X motifs of the first input matrix file. This option can be combined with the option -top1 in order to restrict the analysis to a given subset of a large library.
    type: int
