    Apply hierarchical clustering to identify clusters of similar motifs.
---
parameters:
  - name: matrix_1
    description: The input file contains a set of position-specific scoring matrices (mandatory). If matrix is not specified, use matrix_string option
    type: file
    required: false
  - name: matrix_title_1
    description: The matrix_title will be concatenated to each motif ID in order to create unique motif IDs.
    type: string
  - name: matrix_format_1
    description: Since the program takes several matrices as input, it only accepts matrices in formats supporting several matrices per file (transfac, tf, tab, cluster-buster, cb, infogibbs, meme, stamp, uniprobe).
    type: string
  - name: matrix_2
    description: The input file contains a set of position-specific scoring matrices (mandatory). If matrix is not specified, use matrix_string option
    type: file
    required: false
  - name: matrix_title_2
    description: The matrix_title will be concatenated to each motif ID in order to create unique motif IDs.
    type: string
  - name: matrix_format_2
    description: Since the program takes several matrices as input, it only accepts matrices in formats supporting several matrices per file (transfac, tf, tab, cluster-buster, cb, infogibbs, meme, stamp, uniprobe).
    type: string
  - name: matrix_3
    description: The input file contains a set of position-specific scoring matrices (mandatory). If matrix is not specified, use matrix_string option
    type: file
    required: false
  - name: matrix_title_3
    description: The matrix_title will be concatenated to each motif ID in order to create unique motif IDs.
    type: string
  - name: matrix_format_3
    description: Since the program takes several matrices as input, it only accepts matrices in formats supporting several matrices per file (transfac, tf, tab, cluster-buster, cb, infogibbs, meme, stamp, uniprobe).
    type: string
  - name: matrix_file_table
    description: This option is recommended when the input number of files is large, more than 20, which would have a large command line and some programs are not capable of read such large arguments. The input file contains a tab-delimited table with two columns, the motif file - The path to the file with the motif, and the collection label.
    type: file
  - name: max_matrices
    description: This option specifies how many matrices can be clustered in the same analysis. If there are more matrices than the specified number, the program restrics the analyses to the first X matrices, and issues a warning.
    type: int
  - name: title
    description: Title displayed on top of the report page
    type: string
  - name: ID_link_color_table
    description: This option allows to add a link to a any website specified by the user and can be used to visualize complete databases (e.g. Jaspar), thus each motif in the logo tree will point to its respective link in the Jaspar website.
    type: string
  - name: label_in_tree
    description: Option to select the labels displayed in the logo tree.
    type: string
  - name: task
    description: Specify one or several tasks to be run. Supported tasks - all, comparison, clustering, report
    type: string
    choices: all, comparison, clustering, report
    default: all
  - name: hclust_method
    description: Option to select the agglomeration rule for hierarchical clustering.
    choices: complete, average, single
    type: string
    default: average
  - name: metric_build_tree
    description: Select the metric which will be used to cluster the motifs.based in one metric of to measure motif similarity.
    type: string
    choices: cor, Ncor, dEucl, NdEucl, logocor, logoDP, Nlogocor, Icor, NIcor, SSD, rank_mean, mean_zscore
    default: Ncor
  - name: lth_w
    description: lower threshold.
    type: float
  - name: lth_cor
    description: lower threshold.
    type: float
  - name: lth_Ncor
    description: lower threshold.
    type: float
  - name: uth_w
    description: upper threshold.
    type: float
  - name: uth_cor
    description: upper threshold.
    type: float
  - name: uth_Ncor
    description: upper threshold.
    type: float
  - name: calc
    description: Specify the operator used to merge matrices (argument passed to merge-matrices).
    type: string
    choices: mean, sum
    default: mean
  - name: quick
    description: With this option the motif comparison is done with the program compare-matrices-quick (implemented in C) rather than the program compare-matrices (implemented in Perl).
    type: boolean
  - name: top_matrices
    description: Only analyze the first X motifs of the input file. This options is convenient for quick testing before starting the full analysis.
    type: int
  - name: skip_matrices
    description: Skip the first X motifs of the input file. This options is convenient for testing the program on a subset of the motifs before starting the full analysis.
    type: int
  - name: return
    description: List of fields to return. Supported fields - heatmap,json,newick,root_matrices.
    type: string
    default: json,heatmap
  - name: o
    description: Prefix for the output files.
    type: string
