parameters:
    - name: i
      description: input_file. if not specified, the standard input is used. This allows to place the command within a pipe.

      default: ft
    - name: add_chr
      description: only for BED output - add "chr" in front of the chromosome name and change MT into chrM
      type: boolean
    - name: remove_chr
      description: Remove the "chr" in front of the chromosone and change chrM into MT
      type: boolean
    - name: yeast_to_roman
      description: Convert arabic to roman numbers to denote chromosome numbers according to S.cerevisiae specifications. Only works for chromosomes I to XVI.
      type: boolean
    - name: featname
      description: Set a name for all features of the file. This option can be convenient for conversions to bed files.
      type: boolean
    - name: summits
      description: only valid for SWEMBL input - replace start and end coordinates by peak summit position
      type: boolean
    - name: extend
      description: extend peak coordinates on both sides (start and end).
      type: int
    - name: extend_start
      description: extend start coordinate leftwise.
      type: int
    - name: extend_end
      description: extend end coordinate rightwise.
      type: int
    - name: coord
      description: bedfile with absolute coordinate of the sequence relative to which the features were defined (e.g. features from promoter-wise to genome-wise coordinates).
      type: boolean
    - name: origin
      description: Origin of coordinates relative to sequence fragment. This option is only valid when combined with the option coord.
      type: string
      choices: start,end,center
