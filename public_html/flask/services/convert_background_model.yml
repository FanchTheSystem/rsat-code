parameters:
    - name: i
      description: input_file. The input file contains a background model, in any of the supported formats.
      type: file
    - name: org
      description: organism_name. Specify an organism supported in RSAT, in order to load a background model from the pre-computed organism-specific models supported in RSAT. This option must be combined with the optin -bg.
