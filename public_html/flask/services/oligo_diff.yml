descr:
    Compare oligonucleotide occurrences between two input sequence files ("test" and "control"), and return oligos that are significantly enriched in one of the files respective to the other one.

parameters:
  - name: test
    description: Test sequence file. Both the test and control sequences must be provided in fasta format.
    type: file
  - name: ctrl
    description: Control sequence file.
    type: file
  - name: side
    description: Side of the significance test. In practice, the side is converted into a threshold on the ratio test/control occurrences.
