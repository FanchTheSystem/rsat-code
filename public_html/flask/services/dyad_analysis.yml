descr:
    Detects overrepresented dyads (spaced pairs) in a set of DNA sequences. A dyad is defined here as a pair of oligonucleotides of the same size separated by a fixed number of bases.

parameters:
  - name: i
    description: inputfile. The sequence to be analyzed. Multiple sequences can be entered at once with most sequence formats (see below).
    type: file
    required: false
  - name: mask
    description: Mask lower or uppercases, respecively, i.e. replace selected case by N characters.
    type: string
    choices: upper, lower
    required: false
  - name: format
    description: Input sequence format. Various standards are supported - raw, multi, ig, fasta, wconsensus, ncbi, tab.
    type: string
    choices: raw, multi, ig, fasta, wconsensus, ncbi, tab
    default: fasta
