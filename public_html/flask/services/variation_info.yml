descr:
    Taking as input a set of either variation IDs (rs numbers) or
    genomic regions (bed format), retrieve information about matching
    variants.  The collected information is reported in varBed format,
    which is a specific type of bed format for variations (see
    convert-variations for a detailed description of varBed and for
    interconversions between variation formats).
